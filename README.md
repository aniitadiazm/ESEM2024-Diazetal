# Experimental Materials Repository

Welcome to the repository for the experimental materials related to our study on quantum circuit transformation. This repository contains all the necessary resources, including datasets, questionnaires, and detailed descriptions of the experimental setup.

## Repository Structure

- `datasets/`: Contains all datasets used in the study.
- `questionnaires/`: Includes copies of all questionnaires administered to participants.
- `study_materials/`: Provides additional study materials, including step-by-step guides and examples.
- `experimental_tasks/`: Detailed descriptions of the experimental tasks and procedures.
- `support_materials/`: Resources for additional tutoring and support sessions.

## Description of Contents

### Datasets
The `datasets/` directory contains the data collected during the study. Each dataset includes detailed information on the participants' performance and responses.

### Questionnaires
The `questionnaires/` directory includes copies of all the questionnaires used to assess participants' understanding of quantum circuits and their ability to transform algorithms into quantum circuits. The questionnaires cover various aspects, including the probabilities of qubit states and other technical details.

### Study Materials
The `study_materials/` directory provides supplemental materials designed to support participants in the study. These materials include step-by-step guides for transforming algorithms into quantum circuits and detailed examples.

### Experimental Tasks
The `experimental_tasks/` directory contains detailed descriptions of the tasks that participants were asked to perform during the experiment. This includes both the initial task descriptions and any subsequent tasks related to circuit construction and analysis.

### Support Materials
The `support_materials/` directory includes resources for additional tutoring sessions and individualized support provided to participants. This ensures that all students, regardless of their initial understanding, can successfully engage with the experimental tasks.
